Observable Trends
1. Max temperature increases as latitude approaches 0, or as latitude approaches the equator. However, temperature does max out at around 20 degress latitude not right at the equator. 
2. The plots for humidity and cloudiness don't appear to showing any discernable trend or pattern. The data points appear to be pretty randomly distributed over the graphs. More analysis is needed to determine the drivers of humidity and cloudiness. 
3. Wind speeds don't seem to be fluctuating or changing very much based on latitude as the data points are pretty evenly spread over the latitude measurements. However, the highest wind speed readings are coming from points further away from the equator.
